`New Eden > Pure Blind > 38G6-L > X-70MU`

## expert

[gila](#gila) `blueprints` and `datacores` can be found here: `Unknown for now`

> NOTE: Still to investigate where to find `blueprint` and stuff


# explanation

## missile explanation

You only have to worry about size of the ship you are shooting at and the speed it is moving.

Don't have to worry about transversal velocity or rotation speed of your guns. Neither fall-off range and fall-off damage.

With Missiles following statements are to worry:
- What is the range of your missiles vs the distance to target. Are the target moving away from you? If so will the missile be able to to catch up to target before he moves out of range of missile.
- What is the signature radius of the target vs  your explosion radius. If explosion radius is higher than signature you will lose some damage.
- What is the speed of the target vs your explosion velocity. If the speed of the target is higher than your explosion velocity you will do reduced damage.
- What is the speed of the target vs your missiles velocity. If the speed of the target is higher than your missiles velocity, the target can outrun your missile.
